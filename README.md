# ToDo
A simple todo app for myself

## IMPORTANT
I am currently following [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@taweesoft/chapter-2-read-and-write-to-firebase-real-time-todo-list-with-firebase-react-js-redux-7ff8e4c76893) to make a somewhat more advanced version. I have finished step 2. I need to finish the rest.

## TODO (ironic)
- Add iOS PWA support see [this guide](https://blog.truthlabs.com/building-a-progressive-web-app-in-react-11c77a7fccb3)
